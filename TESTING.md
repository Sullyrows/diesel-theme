# How to Test Your Cat Theme

The package.json appears to be valid. Here's a step-by-step guide to test your theme:

## Option 1: Using F5 (Extension Development Host)

1. **Make sure VS Code is open** with your cat-theme project folder
2. **Press F5** - This should launch a new "Extension Development Host" window
3. In the new window, open the Command Palette with **Cmd+Shift+P**
4. Type "Color Theme" and select **"Preferences: Color Theme"**
5. Look for **"Cat Theme"** in the list and select it

## Option 2: Manual Installation for Testing

If F5 doesn't work, try this approach:

1. Install the VS Code Extension Manager:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @vscode/vsce
   ```

2. Package your extension:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/joe/Git-Projects/cat-theme
   vsce package --no-dependencies
   ```

3. Install the generated .vsix file:
   - Open VS Code
   - Press Cmd+Shift+P
   - Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
   - Select the generated .vsix file

## Option 3: Direct Theme Testing

If you just want to see the colors without installing:

1. Open VS Code Settings (Cmd+,)
2. Search for "workbench.colorCustomizations"
3. Add these settings to test key colors:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "statusBar.background": "#FFC400",
    "statusBar.foreground": "#000000",
    "tab.activeForeground": "#FFC400",
    "activityBar.foreground": "#FFC400",
    "editorCursor.foreground": "#FFC400"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If the theme still doesn't appear:

1. **Check VS Code version**: Make sure you're using VS Code 1.74.0 or newer
2. **Reload VS Code**: Press Cmd+R in the Extension Development Host window
3. **Check console**: Press Cmd+Shift+I to open Developer Tools and look for errors
4. **Verify files**: Make sure all theme files are in the correct locations

The theme should show your #FFC400 amber color in:
- Status bar background
- Active tab text
- Activity bar icons
- Editor cursor
- Line number highlights
- And many other UI elements!
